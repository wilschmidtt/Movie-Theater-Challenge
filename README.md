# Overview

Implement an algorithm for assigning seats within a movie theater to 
fulfill reservation requests. Assume the movie theater has the seating 
arrangement of 10 rows x 20 seats. Design and write a seat assignment 
program to maximize both customer satisfaction and customer 
safety. For the purpose of public safety, assume that a buffer of three 
seats and/or one row is required.

### Input Description

Input file will contain one line of input for each 
reservation request. The order of the lines in the file reflects the order in 
which the reservation requests were received. Each line in the file will be 
comprised of a reservation identifier, followed by a space, and then the 
number of seats requested.

### Output Description
The program will print out the seating assignments for 
each request. Each row in the file includes the reservation number 
followed by a space, and then a comma-delimited list of the assigned 
seats.
