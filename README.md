# Movie-Theater-Challenge

# Instructions
* Compile program with the following command: `gcc -Wall -Werror main.c -o main.o`

### Goals
* Create a simple program to handle reservation requests from an input file and and return the saved seats in an output file

### Shortcomings
* Did not allocate an adequate amount of time towards writing code for this project
* No Makefile used to compile program
* Output is printed to STDOUT instead of written to a text file
* No error checking to handle scenario where theater is currently full
* Did not free dynamically allocated space, program contains memory leaks

### Potential Fixes
* Would spend more time adding documentation to the code and picking better variable names
* Would write output to a text file as opposed to printing to STDOUT
* Would break code into separate functions as opposed to cluttering the main() function
