# Overview

Implement an algorithm for assigning seats within a movie theater to 
fulfill reservation requests. Assume the movie theater has the seating 
arrangement of 10 rows x 20 seats. Design and write a seat assignment 
program to maximize both customer satisfaction and customer 
safety. For the purpose of public safety, assume that a buffer of three 
seats and/or one row is required.
